- **Tree-Structured Logs**: View logs in a structured format that is easy to read.
- **Colored Output**: Get color-coded logs to quickly identify different log levels.
- **Simple Decorator**: Use a straightforward decorator to enable logging.
- **Optimized for AI Code**: Works well with AI-generated codebases.
- **Compatible with Standard Code**: Integrates seamlessly into traditional Python projects.

## Installation

To install Pyhunt, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pyhunt
```

After installation, you can start using Pyhunt in your Python projects.

## Usage

Using Pyhunt is simple. Just import the tool and decorate the functions you want to trace. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
from pyhunt import log

@log
def my_function():
    print("Hello, World!")

my_function()
```

This will generate a structured log of the function call, making it easy to debug and trace.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to help you get started:

### Example 1: Basic Logging

```python
from pyhunt import log

@log
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)
```

### Example 2: Logging with Parameters

```python
from pyhunt import log

@log
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply(4, 7)
print(result)
```

### Example 3: Using in a Class

```python
from pyhunt import log

class Calculator:
    @log
    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

calc = Calculator()
result = calc.subtract(10, 5)
print(result)
```

### Example 4: Handling Exceptions

```python
from pyhunt import log

@log
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
```
